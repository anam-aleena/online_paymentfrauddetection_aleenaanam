# online_paymentfrauddetection_aleenaanam
This online payment fraud detection project aims to help students learn how to build a system that can identify fraudulent online transactions.  The model will work with a dataset of previous online transactions and train machine learning models to recognize patterns that distinguish fraud activities from normal transactions.
